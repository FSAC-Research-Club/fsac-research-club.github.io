# FSAC Research Club

## Objectives and Activities
At the heart of our clubâ€™s mission is the commitment to promote scientific research skills, develop critical thinking, and foster a culture of reproducibility and open science. To achieve these objectives, we have defined several priority areas, along with examples of planned activities:

### 1 â€“ Develop scientific culture and research literacy
Understanding how to read, analyze, and critique scientific papers is essential for training the next generation of researchers.
- Biweekly journal club with presentations and group discussions.
- Workshops on critical thinking and data interpretation, including analysis of biased papers to strengthen analytical skills.
- Training in the use of scientific databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science.

### 2 â€“ Promote reproducibility and open science
Mastering reproducible research practices is essential to ensure transparency and collaboration in modern science.
- Hands-on workshops on GitHub, Jupyter Notebooks, and reproducible workflow best practices.
- Introduction to reference managers (Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote) to facilitate the research process.

### 3 â€“ Develop digital and data analysis skills
Proficiency with digital tools is increasingly crucial in academic and professional environments.
- Introductory workshops on Linux, Bash, and Python for data analysis.
- Accessible sessions on statistics and machine learning applied to science.

### 4 â€“ Connect students to the research world
Exposure to research environments and inspiring role models encourages students to pursue scientific careers.
- Laboratory visits across various disciplines.
- Partnerships with research teams for practical workshops and demonstrations.
- Launch of a research appreciation day (poster session), mainly for graduate students, with undergraduate students participating as audience or volunteers.

### 5 â€“ Strengthen scientific communication and outreach
The ability to communicate clearly is a cornerstone of impactful research.
- Scientific writing workshops on abstracts, CVs, and motivation letters.
- Mini-projects such as article summary writing with peer feedback.
- Conferences and roundtables with alumni, professors, and researchers on career pathways.
- STEM outreach activities for high school students, including lab visits and presentations to foster early interest in research.
